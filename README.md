## ‚ôªÔ∏è Updating

1. Move to a directory before project directory (ex: Project directory is "/path/to/project", move to "/path/to/").

**If you want versions without being latest, check "Releases" page.**

## üòé About
If you're tired of searching for downloaders across the internet cause the domain was been seized,
here are my solution, a CLI and a self-hosted service to avoid these problems, just install and download
videos from your terminal or in-browser running the self-hosted service powered by React, Vite on frontend
and Golang on backend.

<br />

## üìú Requirements:
- Python (<a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> -> REQUIRED FOR DOWNLOADING) 
- Node.JS
- Go
- Yarn (needed to work with workspaces)
